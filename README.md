<em> command organizer tool to hoard all your precious commands üíéüêâ</em>
</p>

![Example usage](img/hoard_usage_example.gif)

#### What is a command organizer?

A command organizer lets you save commands that you often use, but are too complicated or long to remember.
For every **hoarded** command, `hoard` saves

- the command ( parameterized with a customizable token, default `#` )
- name
- description
- namespace where it lives in
- tags ( Optional )

If you get lost in your massive command history, and can't find for example a specific `docker` command out of thousand `docker` commands you've already ran,
just **hoard** it. With a **name** and **description** it will be much easier to find again. When you look for that command again a month later, take a look at your **hoarded** commands.

`hoard` is **not** supposed to replace shell history finder like `fzf` `atuin` or similar utilities. It rather should be used in conjunction with them.

## üì¶ Install

### From source

It's best to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to get setup with a Rust
toolchain, then you can run:

```
cargo install hoard-rs
```

Or build it yourself:

```
cargo build --release
```

Find the binaries in `./target/release/hoard`
Move it to wherever you need it ( Like `/usr/local/bin/hoard` )

### Linux

Tested on:
- Ubuntu

Install `hoard` by running

```
./install.sh
```

If you are running `fish` shell

```
LATEST_RELEASE=1.0.0 ./install.fish
```

### Brew on MacOS
```
brew tap Hyde46/hoard
brew install hoard
```
### Install Shell plugin

Install `hoard` as a plugin to enable autocomplete.
Depending on your shell, run one of the following commands.
To keep it installed for your next shell session, add the `source` command with an absolute path to your `.bashrc` or copy-paste the plugins content to your `.bashrc`.

#### bash

```
source src/shell/hoard.bash
```

#### zsh

```
source src/shell/hoard.zsh
```

#### fish

```
source src/shell/hoard.fish
```
<a name="usage"/>

## ü§∏ Usage

#### Save a new command

```
hoard new
```

If a parameter is not known when saving the command, put a `#` ( Or your customized token from your `~/.config/hoard/config.yml` )

#### Delete a command

```
hoard remove <name>
```

#### Delete all commands in a namespace

```
hoard remove_namespace <namespace_name>
```

#### Edit a command

```
hoard edit <name>
```

#### Info

Shows location of config file and trove file

```
hoard info
```

### Set parameter token

Change parameter token of config file

```
hoard set_parameter_token <parameter_token>
```

#### Search through command trove

```
<Ctrl-h>
```

Or alternatively, if not installed as a plugin, the interactive search can still be performed, though without autocomplete. This assumes the user to copy the command by mouse from the UI

```
hoard list
```

When running `hoard list` as a shell plugin and selecting a parameterized command, `hoard` will ask for all missing parameters to input before sending the complete command to your shell input. 

#### Import other trove files from `trove.yml` or urls pointing to a trove.yml file

```
hoard import /path/to/trove.yml
```
or
```
hoard import https://troves.com/new_trove.yml
```

#### Export trove file
```
hoard export /path/to/exported/trove.yml
```
